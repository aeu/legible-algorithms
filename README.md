# legible-algorithms

Many sample implementations of common algorithms available in textbooks or online are formatted with an emphasis on being terse, as they are often included in papers, journals or books where space is at a premium.  This practice has led to our current state where programmers try to emulate this, and produce code which is unnecessarily terse and difficult to read and learn from.

This is a collection of my implementations that are (hopefully) easier to read, as well as my own test of Cunningham's Law.
