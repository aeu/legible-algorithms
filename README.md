# legible-algorithms

Many sample implementations of common algorithms available in textbooks or online are written in pseudocode, and formatted with an emphasis on being terse, as they are often included in papers, journals or books.  

This is a collection of my implementations that are (hopefully) easier to read and learn from, as well as my own test of Cunningham's Law.  I use languages I like, descriptive function and variable names, and comments.
