Given an array of integers arr, where the length n is even, return
whether the following condition holds for every k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤
n / 2:

The sum of the first k elements is strictly less than the sum of the
first 2k elements.

If the condition is false for any valid k, return false. Otherwise,
return true.
