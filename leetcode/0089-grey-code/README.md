## Leetcode 0089 Gray Code

This isn't really a fair problem because it's mathematical, and
requires memorizing a formula.


Any gray code number in sequence can be calculated with the formula


    g(n) = n ^ ( n >> 1 )

Once you know that, it's just a one-line loop.  This should not be a
leetcode problem at all, there's no actual programming here.
