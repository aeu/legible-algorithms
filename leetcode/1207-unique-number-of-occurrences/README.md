## 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

# Problem Statement

Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

# Examples 

      Example 1:
      Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
      Output: true
      Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.


      Example 2:
      Input: arr = [1,2]
      Output: false
      Example 3:

      Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
      Output: true
 

# Constraints:

      1 <= arr.length <= 1000
      -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000

# Output
