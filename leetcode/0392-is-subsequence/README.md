## Leetcode 392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


# Sample Outputs

      Example 1:
      Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
      Output: true


      Example 2:
      Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
      Output: false
 

# Constraints:

      0 <= s.length <= 100
      0 <= t.length <= 104
      s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
