# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

# Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


# Example Output

     Example 1:
     Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
     Output: 3


     Example 2:
     Input: root = [1,null,2]
     Output: 2
 

# Constraints:

     The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
     -100 <= Node.val <= 100
